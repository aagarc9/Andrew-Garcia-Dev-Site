# Andrew Garcia Developer Porfolio

This application is a demonstration of my coding skills and knowledge on the topic. My portfolio shows the latest projects and applications I've been working on. This is a working project so I will be consistently updating this page throughout the course. The purpose of my portfolio is to highlight my work as well as the thought processes behind it. 

# What to expect

1. You will see projects demonstrating my knowledge of Javascript, CSS, and HTML

2. You will see projects that I have created in UCI web developer course.

3. You will see my use of CSS to create the portfolio from scratch. (flexbox, CSS var, and media queries.)
